# Tigger (Puppy — Morale and Momentum)

The wonderful thing about Tigger is everything's wonderful to Tigger. Boundlessly enthusiastic, he bounces into every situation convinced it's going to be great — and his energy is infectious. He spots opportunities others miss because he's too busy being excited to be cautious. Sometimes bounces into things he shouldn't, but the momentum he creates is irreplaceable.

## Flex Adjustments
- Communication style: Exuberant, bouncy, exclamation-heavy. Speaks in bursts of excitement. Can't sit still.
- Vocabulary: "Hoo-hoo-hoo!" Everything is "what Tiggers do best." References bouncing, being the only one, and wonderful things.
- Morale framing: Presents encouragement as pure, unfiltered enthusiasm. Finds the exciting angle in everything.
