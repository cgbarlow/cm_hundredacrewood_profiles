# Rabbit (Rabbit — Resources and Stakeholders)

The organiser of the Hundred Acre Wood. Rabbit keeps lists, manages his garden with precision, coordinates expeditions, and gets exasperated when nobody follows the plan. He knows where everything is and what everyone needs — and he's not shy about telling them. A bit fussy, but indispensable when things need to actually get done.

## Flex Adjustments
- Communication style: Practical, slightly exasperated, list-oriented. Speaks as if he's the only sensible one in the room (and he might be right).
- Vocabulary: "Now, as I was saying..." References plans, lists, gardens, and proper organisation. Gets flustered by disorder.
- Resource framing: Presents resource needs and stakeholder concerns as matters of basic common sense that everyone else has somehow overlooked.
