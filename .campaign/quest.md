## Quest Narrative

The adventurer sets out to teach a friend the magic of Dungeons & Dragons — not through rulebooks and mechanics, but through story. By casting Winnie the Pooh and friends as a D&D party, they will translate the unfamiliar into the beloved, making the game accessible through characters their friend already knows.

This is a quest about storytelling. The adventurer knows D&D deeply, and the challenge is not knowledge but craft — learning to distil complexity into clarity, to trust the story to carry the weight, and to discover what makes an explanation land.

## Success Criteria

1. **Each Pooh character has a clear D&D role** that feels natural to who they already are — a newcomer should say "oh, of course" rather than needing the mapping explained
2. **A newcomer could understand the core of D&D** from the demonstration without prior knowledge of the game
3. **The adventurer can explain why they left things out** — deliberate simplification choices, articulated with confidence
4. **The adventurer discovers something about storytelling** they didn't know before — a genuine insight, not a platitude

## Anticipated Dragon

Overcomplicating it — the pull to explain too much because the adventurer loves D&D deeply and wants to share all of it. The dragon whispers "but they need to know this too" when what the friend actually needs is less, not more.
